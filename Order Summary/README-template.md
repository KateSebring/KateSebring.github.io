## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the uses of Flexbox. It was interesting to experiment with and see how I could align my elements with Flexbox. I also studied mobile-first development and used a simple media query to change the background.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about Flexbox. I also plan to experiment with Grid and more mobile-first development in my future projects.
